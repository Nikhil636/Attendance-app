    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Nikhil636/Attendance-app.git

* Step 3: Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```

    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```

    ```
     # Track the changes
    git status

     # Add changes to Index
    git add .
     ```
* Step 6: Commit all the changes (Write commit message as "Small Message")
    ```
    git commit -m "Write a meaningful but small commit message"
    ```
* Step 7: Push the changes for review
    ```

4. Participants/contributors can also **open their issues** using issue_template,
but it needs to be verified and labelled by a mentor or PA. Please discuss with the team once before opening your issues. We respect all your contributions, whether
